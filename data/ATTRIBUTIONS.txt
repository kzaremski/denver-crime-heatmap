    Summary:
        This dataset includes criminal offenses in the City and County of Denver 
        for the previous five calendar years plus the current year to date. The 
        data is based on the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) 
        which includes all victims of person crimes and all crimes within an 
        incident. The data is dynamic, which allows for additions, deletions 
        and/or modifications at any time, resulting in more accurate information 
        in the database. Due to continuous data entry, the number of records in 
        subsequent extractions are subject to change. Crime data is updated 
        Monday through Friday.

    I had to do some research... "NOT FOR ENGINEERING PURPOSES." refers to civil or 
    structural engineering and similar uses. We are allowed to use it 
    in this context.
